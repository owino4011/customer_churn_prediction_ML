**Customer Churn Prediction Project**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay with a company. It uses a real-world dataset, explores important features, and applies classification models to make accurate predictions.

# Project Goals
- Analyze customer behavior.
- Preprocess and clean the data.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Provide insights that can help businesses reduce churn rate.

# Project Structure
. â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Contains the dataset (if applicable) â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling â”œâ”€â”€ models/ # Saved machine learning models (optional) â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Project overview and documentation â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # List of Python libraries used (optional)

# Dataset
- **Name**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (or another dataset you used).
- **Source**: [Kaggle Telco Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- **Description**: Includes customer demographics, account details, services used, and churn status.

# Key Steps
1. Data Exploration and Visualization.
2. Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
3. Model Building and Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC).
5. Conclusion and business recommendations.

# How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

   2.Navigate to the project Directory

   cd your-repo-name
   
3.**Open the Jupyter Notebook**

cd your-repo-name

4.**Run the notebook step by step:Customer_churn_Prediction.ipynb**.

**Dependencies**

You can install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ“ˆ **Results and Conclusion**

Best performing model: (e.g., Random Forest with 85% accuracy)
Important features affecting churn: (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges)
